# Sentimental-Analysis-using-ML-and-Wordcloud-generation-with-R
This project revolves around a series of libraries and functions which are used to clean and process the data into a cleanset. Furthermore, sentimental score has been generated along with barplots and wordcloud.
Now, use of pre-defined libraries and functions make it really interesting and easy at the same time because there is a lot of data in it.


**library(tm)**- This library provides us several predefined corces which are later used in data mining and data cleaning.

**library(wordcloud)**- This library is used to give visual representation of text data

Now, for the sentimental analysis of the cleanset several librarires has been used which includes-

**library(syuzhet)**- Gives sentimental score to words.

**library(lubridate)**- Makes easy to work with dates and time 

**library(ggplot2)**- Used in generation of barcharts and wordclouds


**library(scales)**- Used to change the perimeter of charts formed 

**library(reshape2)**- Basically used to do changes in letterClouds

**library(dplyr)**- Consists of set of tools to manipulate R datasets.

Hit a star if you liked this project. will be uploading more projects on C++ and data analytics using open source softwares.
